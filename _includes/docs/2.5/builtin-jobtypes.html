<h2 id="builtin-jobtypes">Built-in Job types</h2>

<p>Azkaban allows custom job types to be added as <a href="#plugins">plugins</a>. However it also supplies several built-in job types. On top of the job parameters that can be set, each job type has additional properties that can be used.</p>

<h3>Command</h3>

<p>Command type of job can be set with <code>type=command</code>. It is a barebones command line executor. Many of the other job types wrap the _command_ job type but constructs their own command lines.</p>

<table class="table table-condensed table-striped table-bordered">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Parameter</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th>Required?</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>command</td>
			<td>The command line string to execute. i.e. <code>ls -lh</code></td>
			<td>yes</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>command. <em>n</em></td>
			<td>Where <em>n</em> is a sequence of integers (i.e 1,2,3&#8230;). Defines additional commands that run in sequential order after the initial command.</td>
			<td>no</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Java Process</h3>

<p>Java process jobs are a convenient wrapper for kicking off Java-based programs. It is equivalent to running a class with a main method from the command line. The following properties are available in javaprocess jobs: </p>

	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Parameter</th>

		</tr>

			<td>no</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>main.args</td>
			<td>A list of comma delimited arguments to pass to the java main function</td>
			<td>no</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>jvm.args</td>
			<td>JVM args. This entire string is passed intact as a VM argument. <code>-Dmyprop=test -Dhello=world</code></td>

<h3>Noop</h3>
