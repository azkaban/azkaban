<h2 id="multipleExecutors-config">Configure executors for Multiple Executor Mode</h2>

<p>We don't have a executor management UI at this point of Time. Executors need to be configured in database. For examples:-</p>

<p>Insert all executors into the mysql DB for executor setups. Verify that correct executors are active in executors table.
<code>insert into executors(host,port) values("EXECUTOR_HOST",EXECUTOR_PORT);</code></p>
