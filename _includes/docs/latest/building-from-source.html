<p>Azkaban builds use <a href="https://gradle.org/" target="_blank">Gradle</a>, and requires a Java JDK, version 8 or higher. Actually, users don't need to install gradle themselves, since we have a gradle wrapper in our repository.</p>


<p>on Unix-like platforms such as Linux and Mac OS X</p>
<pre>
$ ./gradelw distTar
</pre>

<p>on Windows using the gradlew.bat batch file</p>
<pre>
$ gradlew distTar
