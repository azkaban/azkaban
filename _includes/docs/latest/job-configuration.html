<h3>Common Parameters</h3>

<p>Besides the <code>type</code> and the <code>dependencies</code> parameters, there are several parameters that Azkaban reserves for all jobs. All of the parameters below are optional.</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
	<h4>Email properties</h4>
	<p>Note that for email properties, this property is retrieved from the last job in the flow and applied flow level. All other email properties of jobs in the flow are ignored.</p>
</div>


<h3>Runtime Properties</h3>

<p>These properties are automatically added to Azkaban properties during runtime for a job to use.</p>

</table>

<h3>Inherited Parameters</h3>

<p>Any included <code>.properties</code> files will be treated as properties that are shared amongst the individual jobs of the flow. The properties are resolved in a hierarchical manner by directory.</p>

<p>For instance, suppose you have the following directory structure in your zip file.</p>

<pre class="code">
system.properties
baz.job
myflow/
   myflow.properties
   myflow2.properties
   foo.job
   bar.job
</pre>

<p>That directory structure will be preserved when running in Azkaban. The <code>baz</code> job will inherit only from <code>system.properties</code>. The jobs <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> will inherit from <code>myflow.properties</code> and <code>myflow2.properties</code>, which in turn will inherit from <code>system.properties</code>.</p>

<p>The hierarchical ordering of properties in the same directory is arbitrary.</p>

<h3>Parameter Substitution</h3>

<p>Azkaban allows for replacing of parameters. Whenever a <code>${parameter}</code> is found in a properties or job file, Azkaban will attempt to replace that parameter. The resolution of the parameters is done late.</p>

<pre class="code">
# shared.properties
replaceparameter=bar
</pre>

<pre class="code">
# myjob.job
param1=mytest
foo=${replaceparameter}

param2=${param1}
</pre>

<p>In the previous example, before <code>myjob</code> is run, <code>foo</code> will equal <code>bar</code> and <code>param2</code> will equal <code>mytest</code>.</p>

<p>
A parameter cannot contain spaces. Following <code>invalid.job</code> is an example of incorrect parameter name.
</p>

<pre class="code">
# invalid.job
type=command
command=${wh oa mi}
command.1=${whoami }
</pre>

<h3>Parameter Passing</h3>

<p>There is often a desire to pass these parameters to the executing job code. The method of passing these parameters is dependent on the jobtype that is run, but usually Azkaban writes these parameters to a temporary file that is readable by the job.</p>

<p>The path of the file is set in <code>JOB_PROP_FILE</code> environment variable. The format is the same key value pair property files. Certain built-in job types do this automatically for you. The <code>java</code> type, for instance, will invoke your Runnable and given a proper constructor, Azkaban can pass parameters to your code automatically.</p>

<h3>Parameter Output</h3>

<p>Properties can be exported to be passed to its dependencies. A second environment variable <code>JOB_OUTPUT_PROP_FILE</code> is set by Azkaban. If a job writes a file to that path, Azkaban will read this file and then pass the output to the next jobs in the flow.</p>

<p>The output file should be in json format. Certain built-in job types can handle this automatically, such as the <code>java</code> type.</p>
