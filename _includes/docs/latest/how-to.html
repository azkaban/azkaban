<h4>Force execution to an executor</h4>
<p>Only users with admin privileges can use this override. In flow params: set <code>"useExecutor" = EXECUTOR_ID </code>.</p>


<h4>Setting flow priority in multiple executor mode</h4>
<p>Only users with admin privileges can use this property. In flow params: set <code>"flowPriority" = PRIORITY </code>. Higher numbers get executed first.</p>

<h4>Enabling and Disabling Queue in multiple executor mode</h4>
<p>Only users with admin privileges can use this action. Use curl or simply visit following URL:- 
	<ul>
		<li>Enable: <code>WEBSERVER_URL/executor?ajax=disableQueueProcessor</code></li>
		<li>Disable: <code>WEBSERVER_URL/executor?ajax=enableQueueProcessor</code></li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h4>Reloading executors in multiple executor mode</h4>
<p>Only users with admin privileges can use this action. This action need at least one active executor to be successful. Use curl or simply visit following URL:-
	<code>WEBSERVER_URL/executor?ajax=reloadExecutors</code>
</p>	

<h4>Logging job logs to a Kafka cluster</h4>
<p>Azkaban supports sending job logs to a log ingestion (such as ELK) cluster via a Kafka appender. In order to enable this in Azkaban, you will need to set two exec server properties (shown here with sample values):
</p>

<pre class="code">
azkaban.server.logging.kafka.brokerList=localhost:9092
azkaban.server.logging.kafka.topic=azkaban-logging
</pre>

<p>These configure where Azkaban can find your Kafka cluster, and also which topic to put the logs under. Failure to provide these parameters will result in
Azkaban refusing to create a Kafka appender upon requesting one.</p>
<p>In order to configure a job to send its logs to Kafka, the following job property needs to be set to true:
</p>

<pre class="code">
azkaban.job.logging.kafka.enable=true
</pre>

<p>Jobs with this setting enabled will broadcast its log messages in JSON form to the Kafka cluster. It has the following structure:
</p>

<pre class="code">
{
  "projectname": "Project name",
  "level": "INFO or ERROR",
  "submituser": "Someone",
  "projectversion": "Project version",
  "category": "Class name",
  "message": "Some log message",
  "logsource": "userJob",
  "flowid": "ID of flow",
  "execid": "ID of execution"
}
</pre>
