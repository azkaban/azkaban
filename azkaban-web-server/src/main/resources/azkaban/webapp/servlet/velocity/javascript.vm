     * This is to include the 'Azkaban-Trace-Origin' header to all Azkaban API requests made by
     * the web application. $.ajaxSetup is not the recommended place to add it because the
     * settings specified here will affect all Ajax calls including the ones made by any plugins
     * being used. Because it's a custom header, there shouldn't be any issues but
     * ideally there should be wrapper functions around the $.ajax and $.get jQuery functions
     * used by all the views whenever APIs need to be called. Those wrapper functions should
     * apply application related parameters common to all requests such as this header.
